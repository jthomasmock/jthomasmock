### Howdy y'all

I stay busy on GitHub by sharing datasets via the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project along with some various tutorials, my blog, and packages.


## The Mockup Blog

This is my personal blog, you can find it at
[TheMockup.blog](https://themockup.blog/).

If you want to customize your `distill` blog - you can use your own
custom CSS. The CSS components you can change are on the [`distill`
GitHub](https://github.com/rstudio/distill/blob/6be30c96dc469fcc0e3799d23ddfaac72c2a6466/inst/rmarkdown/templates/distill_article/resources/distill.html).

A table of all my posts are below:
